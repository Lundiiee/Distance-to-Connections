1. line 39 of genetics.js -- crossoverParents function.
	swap unusedgene and uncommon gene at the end of the loop.

	- uneeded

2. Clean and document crossoverparents function -eh

3. Check if generations get better over time.

	DONE - 

4. work on real create generation function

	-done

5. Work on rendering a set of connections

6. Work on rendering set(s) of connections

7. Fix bug where duplication of genes happen
	
	a. create return info 

	-has been fixed by rewriting!

8. Remove return info code from todo 7
	-done

9. Work on modified crossover function for varied genome lengths 

10. Work on disuniform distribution random number
	-done

11. When done with doing the modified functions, try to
merge them with the original functions for minimization

12. Merge crossoverParent functions together into
main.genetics 

13. Get rid of initIndividuals function somehow
